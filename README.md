# Shortest-Path-Search-Strategies
This program finds shortest path between two points to travel using BFS, DFS, Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A* search algorithms separately. Program will be given live traffic information in the input.txt file, which is a list of traveling times between intersections/locations.
